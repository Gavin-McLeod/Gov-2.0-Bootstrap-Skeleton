# Gov-2.0-Bootstrap-Skeleton
An HTML5/CSS3/Bootstrap skeleton to accompany the gov.bc.ca. Developer's Guide.

## Governance & Approvals   
All web properties that are created using the Province of B.C. brand/identity must have [received approval](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/about-gov-bc-ca/web-presence/web-property-governance) by Government Communications & Public Engagement Headquarters through the Joint Working Group, the official governing body of web properties for the Province.  If the web property is public facing, it is strongly recommended that this approval is saught before development begins as the project may experience delays, and potential shutdown.  

The use of the Gov-2.0-drupal theme must receive approval by the Joint Working Group, as an exempted web property from the corproate tool set which includes the corporate content management system CMS Lite, Enhanced Search, and WordPress engagement environment.  An example of a successful exemption request would be an application that requires the authentication of a user to gain access to personally identifiable information.  

## Theme Updates
If Government Communications & Publc Engagement updates the design of the corporate tool set of gov.bc.ca web properties, any application built upon the Gov-2.0-Boostrap-Skeleton is mandated to update to the new look and feel.  The new design, standards and requirements will be posted within the gov.bc.ca [Developer's Guide](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/about-gov-bc-ca/web-presence/developers-guide).
